RFID reader based on RC522 module with Wemos and LCD

Initial version, talks rudamentary MQTT

I found a cheap RC522 RFID card reader on eBay [eBay example](https://www.ebay.com/i/112341068592)
and wanted to experiment with it.  In the future, I may
use this to do location-based interactions with the crews (i.e.,
switch list identification, local control unlocking, etc)

At this point, the Wemos D1 Mini can send MQTT messages via WiFi that can be
consumed by other nodes - or even JMRI.
